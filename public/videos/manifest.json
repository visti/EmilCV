    "description": "I wrote this sequencer for the #monomenorns this evening. Based on the idea of a binary tree and split timelines in general, each node is given a random note from a scale and the the tree is then traversed by a playhead. Each time the playhead is faced with the decision of a branching paths, it splits in two (or three) and takes all possible paths creating polymetrix patterns as the roads end at different points.\n\nI just finished reading Blake Crouch\u2019s Dark Matter a few days ago which is a book also about split timelines, so I guess I\u2019ve been subconsciously influenced.",

    "description": "Another norns study: catmull is a chaotic sequencer the draws a curve through user-selected points (using a Catmull-Rom interpolation). The user can then distribute more notes evenly across the spline resulting in weird timings as the spline isn't uniform#. 6 LFOs can be routed to various destinations. Probably not a lot of musical application to this one, but learned a lot about graphics for the norns. #monomenorns #nornsshield",
